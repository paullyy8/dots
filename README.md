hi these are my dotfiles

## Terminal Emulator
I use Alacritty as my terminal. It's super fast and customizable, Also cross platform with Windows and MacOs. 

## Editor
I still primarily use VSCode. I kept it quite minimal and used very few plugins.

Here's the config of: 
- macos
- alacritty
- vscode
